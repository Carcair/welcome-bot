# Welcome Bot for Slack

## Description

Full-stack application for Slack Bot control. The application contains Admin service and User service. Admin has a UI in which he can create messages that are available to Bot or the user. These messages can be connected to a certain date and time of day, linking it to a schedule, or to a certain trigger, linking them to an event, e.g. joining the chat, leaving the chat.
Users donâ€™t have much control of the app, but they will be able to use triggers through certain commands (if Admin specifies it) to prompt bot to send a message.
