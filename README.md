# Welcome Bot for Slack

## Description

Full-stack application for Slack Bot control. The application contains Admin service and User service. Admin has a UI in which he can create messages that are available to Bot or the user. These messages can be connected to a certain date and time of day, linking it to a schedule, or to a certain trigger, linking them to an event, e.g. joining the chat, leaving the chat.
Users donâ€™t have much control of the app, but they will be able to use triggers through certain commands (if Admin specifies it) to prompt bot to send a message.

## Installation
`npm install`

## Start

First step is to create a file called `.env` in root directory. Follow instructions in `envexample` to create its content. DB credentials will be provided on demand.

Run server with:
`npm run start`

or using nodemon for development run:
`npm run dev`

Development is running at http://localhost:5000 by default.

Routes:
`/api/messages`
`/api/schedules`
`/api/triggers`

Using postman you can test, e.g. messages:

- Get method for selecting:
  - all rows:
    `http://localhost:5000/api/messages`
  - one row:
    `http://localhost:5000/api/messages/MESSAGE_TITLE`

- Post method for inserting and editing
  - insert row:
    `http://localhost:5000/api/messages`
  - edit row:
    `http://localhost:5000/api/messages/MESSAGE_TITLE`
  - Post expecting JSON object:
    ```
    {
      "title": "sample_title",
      "text": "sample text",
      "cr_date": "0123456"
    }  
    ```
  - Edit also needs all three variables.

- Delete method:
    `http://localhost:5000/api/messages/MESSAGE_TITLE`

Reason it lacks data processing is because it will be done in front-end, before sending, to ease processing burden on back-end.
